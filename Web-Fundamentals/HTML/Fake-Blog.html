                <h2>Jason Rivas</h2>
                <p>This blog was created to introduce ancient ideas & concepts, philosophical ideas & conspiracy to the new generation(s) that have been hidden from their world & exsistence.</p>
            </div>

            <main>
                <ul>
                    <li>You ever watch the Matrix? It's a great film, but what I'm shortly going to point out & what is important here is the creative, meaningful script that is filled with parables. It's an allegory. A story that is encoded with knowledgable concepts.</li>
                    <li>I'm not going to go over the plot, but the concept of hidden knowledge is the subject. Now there is something, if you don't already know, is the matrix represent the reality you've been programmed to believe.</li>
                    <li>So with that said, I'll give you another great example of an allegorical story. The Judo-Chrisitian bible.</li>
                    <li>Now your probably wondering what my point is, but don't worry. You'll slowly understand.</li>
                    <li>Before I go into this, I need you to understand something important. I'll being going into sensative subjects. This paper is strictly written to spread ideas. I'm not forcing ideas onto anyone. If you actually made it this far & you're already hooked, than your job is to take this new information & make use of it or discard it.</li>
                    <li>If these ideas and concepts weren't important, then this paper wouldn't be written in the first place.</li>
                    <li>Okay, now I'll start by asking a question. Do you know what a <strong>Dark-Saying</strong> is? Here are a couple of examples:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>She broke my heart (your heart isn't literaly broken)</li>
                        <li>My head was about to explode (your head isn't literaly going to explode)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>This is a dark saying. It's a riddle that's waiting to be revealed by someone.</li>
                    <li>It is clear, once you escape the matrix, that our fellow men, women & children are being programmed to become secular, narcissistic, unhealthy robots.</li>
                    <li>Our educational schools, universities & institutions have been purposely designed to literaly lower humanities mental capabilities.</li>
                    <li>leading students to become followers of science instead of teaching spirituality beside it, hiding God in the process.</li>
                    <li>If</li>
                    <li>Children are introduced to social media which isn't filtered, exposing their young minds to advertisements, social trends (the list goes on), ultimately influencing them. </li>
                    <li>Everyday, more of these people's connection to their culture and traditions are fading.</li>
                    <li>People are completely oblivious to what is happening. Especially in the shadows.</li>
                    <li><strong>Banks, Media, Big Tech., Politics</strong></li>
                    <li>Science can't explain how psychedelics seem to dramtically alter the human mind.</li>
                    <li>There are <strong>several</strong> accounts of OBE (out of body experiences), either when psychedelically induced, or when NDE's (near death experiences) occur.</li>
                    <li>There are accounts of blind people when under anesthesia, suddenly find themselves floating above their body, with their vision back. Being able to accurately recall what the surgoen was doing, only for the surgoen to completely baffled at not only what this one patient was describing, but rather several other similar accounts.</li>
                    <li>When the anesthesia fades, it comes to their attention when they re-awaken, that they're blind again.</li>
                    <li>Some don't know what is happening because these well-known concepts that were universal, now are forgotten. Some people under anesthesia even go around to other rooms in the hospital.</li>
                    <li>Quantum physics seem to prove other wise, that nothing is actually experienced without consciousness. Scientist can't even explain consciousness to begin with.</li>
                    <li>Could it be because an omniscient, omnipresent entity is the designer?</li>
                    <li>Why is that Christianity, Buddisim, Hinduism teach the same universal concepts? & why are these concepts taken from even older religions?</li>
                    <li>We're definetly not thought this in school. You would need to learn this deep in the internet or through a source that's knowledgeable in this topic.</li>
                    <li>Why is the concept of God drilled into everyones mind? Why do you think the concept of God is still around?</li>
                    <li>Is it because God lives within all of us? Think about it. New age pyshics acknowledges that nothing is ever still & that no one thing is exactly the same.</li>
                    <li>If nothing is ever still, than what energy is making this meta(any)-thing move? Is it the energy that comes from the ether? (Gods energy)</li>
                    <li>If a pine-tree is classified as a pine-tree, but no pine-tree is ever the same, then of what is this tree or anything made of?</li>
                    <li>The point is, this meta(any)-thing is what God is. He isn't seperate from us, but rather we are smaller-packets of himself & every other thing is made of him.</li>
                    <li>Modern "science" claims the world was nothing, but suddenly came into exsistence through a "Big Bang" that shot out gases & matter which eventually created planets and suns, then there was water & through that, fungi formed then evlolved into water inhabitents, then evolved again into walking mamals, also came apes that evolved into humans.</li>
                    <li>Although this is clearly THEORY through speculative arguments, they still claim there theory of this "Big Bang" is more plausable for the worlds exsistence rather than being intelligently created.</li>
                    <li>With there own calulations through their own mathmatical equations, they claim that if everything didn't happen even to the smallest degree, the chances would be impossibily impossible.</li>
                    <li>Through self experimentation and self observation, it is clear that we live on a plane & not a plane(t). Water is always leveled & there is no evidence to prove that water can bend to the exterior of a shape ( a ball) through a mystical force called "gravity".</li>
                    <li>If evidence proves Earths landscape to be unmistakingly flat, this would make Astronomy complete science fiction & Astrophysics fake math. A masonic lie that is pushed to people who are actually interested in their exsistence.</li>
                    <li>NASA collects millions of <strong>TAX PAYING DOLLARS</strong> for the sole purpose of "education" & to "explore the cosmos". Don't fall for their obviosuly CGI photography.</li>
                    <li>NASA was able to broadcast a full mission to the moon & back, but their insanely expensive "satelites" experience software, network errors while "orbiting" Earth. So has technology got worse in the last 50 years? Definetly not.</li>
                    <li>They say things fall because large bodies of matter have a electromagnetic force that is caused by their bodies core, but we're obviously thought in physics class that things fall or rise through density & buoyancy. There is no evidence that density and "gravity" co-exsist to alter these objects positions.</li>
                    <li>Einsteins theory of relativity claims that nothing is only up or down, but that is exatly what it is. You either fall if you're heavier than oxygen|H20, or you rise if you're lighter than H20|Oxygen</li>
                    <li>As you can see, there is something more sinister going on. One can ask:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Who is doing this?</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Why are they doing it?</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>How are they doing it?</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>The following links are to third-party, non-mainstream sources:</li>
