                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript llives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><span class="definition">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are contrainers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript cariables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="tag">var x;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="definition">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignmnet operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="tag">var x = 10;</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="definition">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to now the data type. These are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="tag">true</span> or <span class="tag">false;</span> null - null aka nothing; Number - <span class="tag">42</span> or <span class="tag">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="tag">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="tag">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="tag">{first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="definition">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different descions - hitting different code blocks based on calues or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="tag">if</span> a specificed condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="tag">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="tag">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="definition">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will retreat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p></li>
                    <li><p><span class="definition">Funtion</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code black. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p></li>
