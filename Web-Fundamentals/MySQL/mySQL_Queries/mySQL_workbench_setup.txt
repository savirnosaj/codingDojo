To Do: MySQL Workbench Setup
Use MySQLWorkbench to connect to your localhost.

1. To connect to a specific database, run USE [databasename] in the query box.
-> USE twitter;

Try the queries that you would need to make a CRUD application
(create, read, update, delete):

2. INSERT -
-> INSERT INTO users (id, first_name, last_name, handle, birthday, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (6, 'Jason', 'Rivas', 'savirnosaj', '1998-06-30', NOW(), NOW());

3. SELECT -
-> SELECT first_name, handle, birthday FROM users WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';

4. UPDATE -
-> UPDATE users SET handle = 'iKnowSQL', updated_at = NOW() WHERE first_name = 'Jason' AND last_name = 'Rivas';

5. DELETE -
-> DELETE FROM users WHERE birthday > '1998-00-00';
